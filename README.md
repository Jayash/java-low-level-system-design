 ## The SOLID principles of Object Oriented Design include these five principles
 
 - S – Single Responsibility Principle. A Class should have a single responsibility.
 - O – Open/Closed Principle. Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
 - L – Liskov Substitution Principle. Objects in a program should be replaceable by subclasses of same type without any adverse impact.
 - I – Interface Segregation Principle. Multiple client specific interfaces are preferable over single generic interface.
 - D – Dependency Inversion Principle. Program should depend on abstract entities. It should not depend on concrete implementation of an interface.
